Examples To evaluate in the report:

Valid Examples:
 (A B)
 abc
 a b c
 a (b c)
 (\x a b)
 \x. a b
 (\x((a) (b)))

Invalid Examples:
 \ (missing variable after lambda).
 \x (missing expression after lambda abstraction).
 ((x (missing closing parenthesis).
 () (missing expression).
 a (b (missing closing parenthesis).
 a (b c)) (input not fully parsed).


Regarding the "Examples with Parsing Techniques:" part, you just need to cover only the Examples mentioned in the "Hand out document", not the .txt files on brightspace , which are 13 examples. And you don't have to build the parse tree. Just show the steps like we did in the lecture.

For the invalid examples, you just do as much as you can and then say "there is an error" at this point.
